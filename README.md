What is the CLIP-seq pipeline ?
-------------------------------

CLIP-seq was set up to process CLIP sequencing data from aligned sequencing reads. It is a pipeline including two parts: i/ the reads processing (cleaning, mapping, peak calling and annotation of peaks) and ii/ the differential analysis The normalization step in the differential analysis can be defined as the normalization of the number of reads in a peak (in CLIP-seq samples) by the number of reads in the gene (in RNA-seq sample) where the peak is located on the gene.

For any questions about the pipeline, please contact mandy.cadix@curie.fr

How to install it ?
-------------------

The following dependancies are required :
\* R (\>3.2.0) with the *RColorBrewer*, *ggplot2*, *rtracklayer*, *DESeq2*, *magrittr*, *dplyr*, *qplots*, *Rsubread*, *plyr* and *GenomicRanges* packages
\* Samtools (\>1.1)
\* BEDTools (\>2.21.0)
\* Python (\>2.7.9) with the *os* and *argparse* packages
\* Cutadapt (\>1.8.2)
\* Tophat (\>2.0.14)
\* Java/jkd (\>1.7.0\_45)
\* Picard\_tools
\* Piranha (\>1.2.1)

To install the CLIP-seq pipeline, simply extract the archive and set up the configuration file with the paths to dependencies.

Annotation Files
----------------

The pipeline is using a annotation files with gene annotation information. These file is based on UCSC Refseq gene. WINDOW\_SIZE is a parameter to select a part of around the end of gene (upstream or downstream at the end of gene), this size is pb unit. In order to generate all required annotation files, please set the ANNOTATION\_DIR, ORG, UCSC\_EXPORT and WINDOW\_SIZE in the configuration file.

``` {.sourceCode .guess}
BUILD_ANNOT=1
ORG=hg19
UCSC_EXPORT=refseq_export_hg19.csv
WINDOW_SIZE=100
```

CLIP-seq will start by creating the annotation files in the forder ANNOTATION\_DIR/ORG/ The annotation only have to be generated once. Human annotation are provided with the pipeline.

Trimming
--------

To treat reads with adapter, it is necessary to know side adapters 5' (P5) and 3' (P7):

``` {.sourceCode .guess}
ADAPTERP5="GTTCAGAGTTCTACAGTCCGACGATC"
ADAPTERP7="TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG"
```

How to use it ?
---------------

**PART 1 : reads processing** CLIP-seq can be used for a single sample. In order to use the pipeline, please set up the configuration according to your analysis, and run the following command to do the preprocessing data:

``` {.sourceCode .guess}
/script/pipeline_clip-seq.bash -c CONFIG -i INPUT_FILE -s STEP -n SAMPLE_NUMBER -o OUTPUT_DIR
```

> -c The TXT format configuration file. -i The fastq format file of the CLIP-seq sample. -s The steps of this pipeline that is to be launched. There are 15 differents steps: clean\_fastq -\> this step permits to remove reads which have had problems with the sequencer. CAUTION: only the files in fastq format are accepted trimming -\> this step permits to remove adapters and to select reads with a minimum of nucleotides. mapping -\> this step permits to map reads on tophat2. MAPQ -\> this step permits to use the mapping quality to select reads. On this step we create a sort file. duplicate\_reads -\> this step permits to remove (or only mark) the duplicated reads. On this step we create a index file. peak\_calling -\> this step permits to detect peaks. annotation\_gene -\> this step permits to build an annotation file. treatment\_peaks\_file -\> this step permits to adapt the peak file for the annotation step. annotation\_peaks -\> this step permits to annotate peaks. annotation\_peaks\_last\_exon -\> this step permits to annotate peaks present in the last exon region. annotation\_peaks\_downstream -\> this step permits to annotate peaks present in the downstream region from the end of the gene. annotation\_peaks\_upstream -\> this step permits to annotate peaks present in the upstream region from the end of the gene. annotation\_peaks\_extended -\> this step permits to annotate peaks present in all gene and the downstream region from the end of the gene. all -\> this step permits to launch all previous step. -n The sample identifiers (only numbers). -o The output directory -h Print help message

**PART 2 : differential analysis** If you want to compare treated VS untreated please enter treated samples before untreated samples (for RNA-seq, CLIP-seq and group) Run the following command to do the differential analysis:

``` {.sourceCode .guess}
/script/pipeline_differential_analysis.bash -c CONFIG -l INPUT_LIST -b BAM_RNA_FILES -s STEP -n SAMPLE_TO_COMBINE -g SAMPLE_GROUP -o OUTPUT_DIR
```

> -c The TXT format configuration file. -l The TXT format file of BED files, obtained from the previous script, organized like this: .. code-block:: guess
>
> > id\_CLIP\_sample path\_of\_bed\_file condition\_of\_this\_sample
> >
> > condition\_of\_this\_sample is the condition of the sample (e.g: Untreated, treated ...) CAUTION: Condition must be write with letters (no number or symbol)
>
> -b The TXT format file of BAM file sorted of RNA-seq samples. It organized like this:  
> ``` {.sourceCode .guess}
> ```

> id\_CLIP\_sample path\_of\_bam\_file condition\_of\_this\_sample

> -s The steps of this pipeline that is to be launched. There are 7 differents steps:  
> concatenate\_peaks -\> this step permits to concatenate peaks present in differents CLIP-seq files. merge\_peaks -\> this step permits to merged peaks between differents CLIP-seq samples. tableOfCounts\_peaks -\> this step permits to create a table of counts of peaks detected in CLIP-seq samples. tableOfCounts\_genes -\> this step permits to create a table of counts of genes detected in RNA-seq samples. concatenate\_peaks\_genes -\> this step permits to concatenate tables of counts of CLIP-seq and RNA-seq in the same file. differential\_analysis -\> this step permits to make the differential analysis. color\_peaks -\> this step permits to create a file with rgb code color per peak all -\> this step permits to launch all previous step.
